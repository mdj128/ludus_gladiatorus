// It is the year 50BC. 21 years ago, with discipline breaking down, Spartacus brought 
// the remaining of his army on the oncoming legions. In his last stand, the Battle of the Siler River the vast majority of his men 
// were killed on the battlefield. All ancient historians stated that Spartacus was also killed in the same battle. However, his body
// was never found...

// Back in Rome, and throughout the Empire, gladiator games continue to be extremely popular, and lucrative for those
// that choose to risk everything they have on running a Ludus. You've led a mediocre life as a merchant, but have always
// had a passion for the games, and although it was many decades ago your memories of Spartacus in the arena are still as vivid
// as if they had happened just yesterday. With no family or any legacy to leave behind, you yearn for more, some higher purpose in life. 
// As fate would have it, one day you see a papyrus scroll advertising an old abandoned Ludus for sale. Your life savings are just enough
// to make the purchase. Before you can change your mind, you track down the seller and make the purchase. This is what you were meant
// to be. this is when your life truly begins.

// As you look around the Ludus you've purchased, your gut sinks in realization that you may have just made the worst mistake of your life.
// Just then, you hear a pounding at the front gates. You rush and open them up, and in front of you stands a tall muscular man.
// "Dominus! Are you the owner of this Ludus?"
// "Yes.." you reply hesitantly.
// "I have travelled here in search of glory. None of the other Domini will take me. I have trained hard, this is what I was meant to be.
// will you take me as a gladiator?"
// You look the man over. You need gladiators. How were you even going to be able to do this?
// "Yes!" you sputter. "Yes, you may join. But you should know, you will be my first gladiator. And I will need your loyalty. Together
// we will do many great things."

// Enter starter gladiator creation mode: level 1, 12 stat points to spend. Can choose portrait, origin, etc.

// After creation finishes, enter dialog:
// Gladiator: "By the way, I didn't even ask, what is your name, Dominus?"
// Prompt to enter name, which will become house of [x] on the main Ludus screen

// Gladiator: "It's great to meet you. Thank you for believing in me. I've found some old equipment down here in the training
// storage room. Just tell me what to do. I am ready to fight for our house!"


// This file will contain methods and object specs from the Ludus (contains everything) all the way down to its gladiators, their stats, their items, etc.
// Every object in the hierarchy should contain basic properties only, no functions or circular references. That way,
// the ludus object can be serialized as json. Doing this all by hand right now, eventually we could use redux, react context,
// etc. Just trying to keep it simple as long as possible. Serialization could just go into local storage to start.
